# Wabi-Sabi Projects

Collection projects that are not perfectly done to become a repo, but provided immense learning opportunity.
These very interesting problems, that might interest me (or anyone) in future to take and fix/build on them to become a good piece of work, like pottery repaired with the gold seams of [kintsugi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi)

Refer readme inside each folder for more details.
