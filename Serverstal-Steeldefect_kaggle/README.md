# Severstal: Steel Defect Detection - Kaggle
### [Kaggle Contest](https://www.kaggle.com/c/severstal-steel-defect-detection/overview)

Task: Localize and classify surface defects on a steel sheets (Semantic Segmentation)

## Overview
The production process of flat sheet steel is especially delicate. From heating and rolling, to drying and cutting, several machines touch flat steel by the time itâ€™s ready to ship. Today, Severstal uses images from high frequency cameras to power a defect detection algorithm. <br>
Competition involved developing models for localizing and classifying surface defects on a steel sheet.

**Evaluation:**
The Dice coefficient can be used to compare the pixel-wise agreement between a predicted segmentation and its corresponding ground truth. The formula is given by: <br>

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE{\frac{2\times |X \cap Y|}{|X| %2B |Y|}}">

where X is the predicted set of pixels and Y is the ground truth. The Dice coefficient is defined to be 1 when both X and Y are empty.
