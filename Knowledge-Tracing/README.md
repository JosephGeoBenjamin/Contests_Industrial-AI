# Knowledge Tracing Models

Some Attempts on solving Knowledge Tracing for Digital Learning enhancement
carried out whilst at OneFourthLabs.

Task: Knowledge tracing is a technique used in educational data mining and artificial intelligence in education (AIED). It involves modeling the knowledge of students as they interact with educational material, such as lessons or exercises. The main goal of knowledge tracing is to predict a student's mastery or understanding of specific concepts over time based on their interactions, such as correct or incorrect responses to questions or tasks.
