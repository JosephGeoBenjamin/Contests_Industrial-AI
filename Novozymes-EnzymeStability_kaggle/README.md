# Novozymes Enzyme Stability Prediction
### [Kaggle Contest](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/novozymes-enzyme-stability-prediction)

Task: Identifying the thermostable mutations in enzymes by predicting `tm` experimental melting temperature (Ordinal/Regression)

### Problem Overview
Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts in the chemical reactions of living organisms. The goal of this competition is to predict the thermostability of enzyme variants. The experimentally measured thermostability (melting temperature) data includes natural sequences, as well as engineered sequences with single or multiple mutations upon the natural sequences. Understanding and accurately predict protein stability is a fundamental problem in biotechnology. Its applications include enzyme engineering for addressing the worldâ€™s challenges in sustainability, carbon neutrality and more. Improvements to enzyme stability could lower costs and increase the speed scientists can iterate on concepts.
